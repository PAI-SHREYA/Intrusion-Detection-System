# Intrusion-Detection-System
**About The Project:**
This research project introduces a novel Intrusion Detection System
(IDS) for edge computing, blending Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) and Random Forests for feature reduction, with a focus on anomaly
detection. The use of quantization techniques on ensembled CNN models
is a key aspect, ensuring the system remains lightweight while preserving
detection accuracy. This approach is particularly effective in resourcelimited
settings, responding to the need for efficient cybersecurity in
such environments. The ensemble model, after quantization, achieved an
accuracy of 98.13% and attained a 50% reduction in size, maintaining
robust detection capabilities even in constrained resource scenarios. The
study’s results indicate a remarkable achievement in balancing computational
efficiency with high detection performance, marking a significant
step in edge-deployable cybersecurity technologies.
